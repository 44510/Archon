# Archon
A Home Server for media streaming, game streaming, home automation and management.

Docker and Portainer are used to manage the majority of the software on this server. It is expected that Ubuntu Server OS will be the base OS.

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/Protektor-Desura/Archon/wiki) for more documentation on setting up the server.
