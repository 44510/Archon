# Archon
A Home Server for media streaming, game streaming, home automation and management.

Archon is a Greek word that means "ruler". This will help you take control of your home and your internet connection.

<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer</a> are used to manage the majority of the software on this server. It is expected that <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu Server</a> will be the base operating system.

Please read the <a href="https://github.com/Protektor-Desura/Archon/wiki">Wiki</a> for more documentation on setting up the server.
